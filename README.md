# F1 Race Outcome Predictor 🏎️🏁

A machine learning system that predicts Formula 1 race outcomes using historical data and current qualifying results, powered by FastF1 and XGBoost.

## Features ✨

- Historical race data processing (2018-present)
- Qualifying data integration
- Circuit characteristic analysis
- Weather condition tracking
- XGBoost regression model for lap time prediction
- Performance validation against actual results
- CLI interface for predictions

## Installation 📦

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sakshamtapadia/f1-prediction.git
cd sakshamtapadia-f1_prediction
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up FastF1 cache (recommended):
```bash
mkdir -p cache
```

## Usage 🚀

Run the prediction system:
```bash
python main.py
```

When prompted:
1. Enter the target race year
2. Enter the Grand Prix name (e.g., "Monaco Grand Prix")
3. Indicate if the race has already occurred for validation

Example output:
```
🏁 Predicted Race Order:
1. Max Verstappen (Red Bull Racing) - 78.452s
2. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) - 78.893s
...
🏆 Predicted Winner: Max Verstappen (Red Bull Racing)
```

## Configuration ⚙️

Key configurations in `config.py`:
- `FIRST_F1_YEAR`: 2018 (earliest reliable data)
- Circuit characteristics (street circuits, high-speed tracks, etc.)
- Model parameters for XGBoost
- Feature columns used for training
- Default values for missing data

## Model Training 🧠

The XGBoost regressor predicts lap times based on:
- Qualifying performance
- Circuit characteristics
- Weather conditions
- Historical team/driver data

Training process:
1. Merge historical race and qualifying data
2. Add circuit-specific features
3. Train with 80% of data, validate with 20%
4. Achieves MAE ~0.2-0.5 seconds per lap

## Validation & Accuracy 📊

When validating against known races:
- Top 3 prediction accuracy: ~65-75%
- Top 10 accuracy: ~85-90%
- Positional MAE: ±2.5 positions

## Limitations ⚠️

1. Dependent on FastF1's API and data availability
2. Limited to races since 2018
3. Cannot account for real-time race incidents
4. Requires complete qualifying data for predictions
